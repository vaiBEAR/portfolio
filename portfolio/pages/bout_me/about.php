                    <p>I'm Luiz Gustavo. I'm a santista. I studied English at Wizard. I did systems development technician and studied systems analysis. Moving on, I'm also studying for the AFA. Despite always studying, I never had a word, so I just have one good arm. That's why I really want to join this area anyway. While I'm not where I wanted to be, I worked as a cashier, meat cooker, electronic seller, and did polict campain. I enjoy studying (as you can see), playing any game with friends, spending time with my family doing nothing, and going to the gym. My professional goal is to make a difference, to be the revolution if necessary, and to do so, I must enter the system, that is, join this field.Â </p>
